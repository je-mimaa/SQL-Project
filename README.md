# SQL Project: Analysis of Revenue and Traffic Patterns

##   My first ever finalized SQL project. This SQL-based project analyzes transport service data across various UK cities to uncover patterns in revenue and passenger flow. The analysis involves monthly aggregations, category comparisons, and daily peak identification using SQL queries for practical business intelligence.
